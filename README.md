# ShowDelegates

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that shows delegates and hidden items in the inspector panel.

The hidden items thing doesn't really make sense because of the mod's name but as far as I know it only shows the components field on slots and users.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [ShowDelegates.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/ShowDelegates/releases/latest/download/ShowDelegates.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
